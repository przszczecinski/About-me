# About me

I'm a student of Mathematics in Information Sciences at Warsaw University of Technology. I have obtained a bachelor's, the subject of my BA was Fuzzy Rough Sets.

I find learning new technologies as interesting and challenging, so I spend my spare time on reading books and doing courses in Udemy platform.
